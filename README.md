# Decentralised Data Interface System
Or Ddist for short

Ddist is a Docker based Umbrel application for quickly spinning up and hosting Application Computer Interfaces (or APIs).

V1.0 The goal of the first implementation is to build a simple Docker based API with basic data interfacing functionalities:

- Ability to create one or multiple API instances with named endpoint.
- Ability to upload a .json file to that instance that can be directly queried over the internet.
- Ability for the owner of an endpoint instance to POST, PUT or DELETE .json data.
- Simple User interface

V1.1
- Ability to query a nodes available endpoints including some metadata.
- Ability to activate and deactive API instances.
- Ability to set API rate limits.
- Security features

v2.0 (Future ideas)
- List of other people's endpoints.
- Ability to save and query other people's endpoints and save data in the app.
- Ability to set permissions on endpoints.
- Ability to request lightning payments for data.
